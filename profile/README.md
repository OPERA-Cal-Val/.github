## OPERA Project Science Team Calibration and Validation Guides and Notebooks

Our organization contains repos for calibration and validation of the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) products. Currently, we have repos for OPERA products including the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx) and coregistered single-look complex (CSLC). A complete description of the OPERA products can be found here: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products. In the future, we will have calibration and validation repos for all OPERA products.

**DSWx repos include:**
- calval-DSWx 
  - Tools for validating OPERA DSWx products. 
- DSWx-Validation-Experiments 
  - A location to share new and/or experimental DSWx validation scripts and notebooks.
- DSWx-Jupyter-Validation-Dataset-Generation
  - Demonstrates how to generate DSWx validation data from PlanetScope using a semi-automated approach using scikit-learn in Python.
- DSWx-SCP-validation-generation 
  - Demonstrates how to generate DSWx validation data from PlanetScope satellite optical imagery using Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin in QGIS.

**CSLC repos include:**
- calval-CSLC 
  - Tools for validating CSLC products.

**RTC repos include:**
- calval-RTC 
  - (future home of Tools for validating RTC products.)

In the near future we will add repos for DIST and radiometric terrain-corrected (RTC) products. In the far future we will add repos for land-surface deformation (DISP) products.
