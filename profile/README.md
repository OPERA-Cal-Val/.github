## OPERA Project Science Team Calibration and Validation Guides and Notebooks

Our organization contains repos for calibration and validation of the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) products. Currently, we have repos for OPERA products including the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx), Land Surface Disturbance (DIST), Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC), and the Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC). In the future we will add repos for Land Surface Displacement (DISP) products.
